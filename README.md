# OpenSheetMusicEducation

[opensheetmusiceducation.org](https://opensheetmusiceducation.org/)

See our sister project [OpenSheetMusicDisplay](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay), our underlying rendering technology used to display the sheets in OSMD.

Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and released under [BSD license](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay/blob/develop/LICENSE).

Try the [Demo](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.github.io/demo/) to see what OSMD can do.

# Run a local demo

This debugging guide assumes you have setup the project correctly, see [Build Instructions](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay/wiki/Build-Instructions).

To run the local demo and test your MusicXML files:
* run `npm start` in your cloned repository folder
* open `http://localhost:8000/` in your Browser
* To render your own MusicXML file, drag&drop it into the window.
* It should look similar to our [public demo](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.github.io/demo/), except for a different interface and state of code.<br>
The public demo is on the state of the last release, which can be useful to compare.
